# SQL-portfolio


Explore business cases with me as I showcase my data analysis skills using SQL. From initial exploration to practical conclusions, each project unfolds the story hidden in the data.

Cases so far:

Analyzing order-level data, the exploration targets factors like time patterns, revenue issues, and food preferences to uncover actionable insights.
