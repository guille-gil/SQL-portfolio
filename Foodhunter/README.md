# FoodHunter SQL Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the SQL project focused on FoodHunter, a well-funded food delivery app celebrated for its diverse restaurant options offering multiple cuisines with swift delivery. Despite past success, FoodHunter has encountered a consistent downward trend in monthly revenues over the last quarter. In response to this challenge, the company seeks to comprehend the various factors contributing to this decline.

Our mission is to analyze the available data at the order level, encompassing crucial information such as cuisines, restaurants, delivery times, ratings, and more. The dataset is organized into six distinct tables within a relational database, providing a comprehensive view of the company's operations.

## Exploration Hypotheses

To guide our investigation, we have formulated six initial hypotheses or potential areas of concern that could be contributing to the observed trends:

1. **Time-based Problems:** Explore whether specific times of the day or days of the week correlate with decreased revenue.

2. **Revenue-related Factors:** Investigate any financial elements, such as pricing changes or promotional strategies, influencing the decline in revenues.

3. **Delivery Partner Problems:** Examine the performance of delivery partners to identify any issues affecting delivery times or customer satisfaction.

4. **Food Preferences & Quality:** Analyze the impact of different cuisines, restaurants, and overall food quality on customer satisfaction and repeat business.

5. **Marketing Factors:** Assess the effectiveness of marketing efforts and campaigns in attracting and retaining customers.

6. **Customer Reviews:** Investigate how customer reviews and ratings contribute to the overall revenue trends.

These hypotheses serve as the starting point for our exploration within the database. We will delve into the data to validate, refine, or discover new insights related to each hypothesis, aiming to provide actionable recommendations for FoodHunter. Stay tuned for updates as we progress through the various stages of this SQL project!
