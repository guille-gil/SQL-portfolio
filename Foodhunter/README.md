# FoodHunter SQL Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the SQL project centered around FoodHunter, a well-funded food delivery app known for its expansive range of restaurant options featuring diverse cuisines and prompt delivery services. Despite previous success, FoodHunter has observed a consistent decline in monthly revenues over the last quarter. In response to this challenge, the company aims to uncover the various factors contributing to this downturn.

Our objective is to analyze the available relational database at the order level, including essential details such as cuisines, restaurants, delivery times, ratings, and more. This dataset is structured across six distinct tables within a relational database, offering a comprehensive snapshot of the company's operational landscape.

## Exploration Hypotheses

To guide our investigation, we have formulated six initial hypotheses or potential areas of concern that could be contributing to the observed trends:

1. **Time-based Problems:** Explore whether specific times of the day or days of the week (weekday vs weekend) correlate with decreased revenue. For example, families may tend to eat together during weekends. 

2. **Revenue-related Factors:** Investigate any the effect of any discounts over the final revenue, i.e., whether they have reduced, increased or they had no effect over the total orders. 

3. **Delivery Partner Problems:** Examine the performance of delivery partners to identify any issues affecting delivery times or customer satisfaction. Delivery duration will be key here.

4. **Food Preferences & Quality:** Analyze whether customers prefer to order breakfast, lunch or dinner. Analyse vegetarian vs non-vegetarian preferences. Investigate whether food quality has reduced over time resulting in a decreased rating.

5. **Marketing Factors:** Explore whether marketing expense has remained the sense for the different marketing channels. Investigate the effect over the total orders.

6. **Customer Reviews:** Investigate how customer reviews and ratings contribute to the overall revenue trends. Explore how ratings affect at an individual restaurants level.

These hypotheses serve as the starting point for our exploration within the database. We will delve into the data to validate, refine, or discover new insights related to each hypothesis, aiming to provide actionable recommendations for FoodHunter. Stay tuned for updates as we progress through the various stages of this SQL project!
