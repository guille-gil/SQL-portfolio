## Hypothesis 1: Time-based Problems
To explore if specific times of the day or days of the week correlate with decreased revenue, we'll analyze the **orders table**, focusing on the *order_id*, *order_time*, and *delivered_time* columns.


```sql
-- SQL Query for Hypothesis 1
SELECT
  DAYOFWEEK(order_time) AS day_of_week,
  COUNT(order_id) AS order_count,
  AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, order_time, delivered_time)) AS avg_delivery_time
FROM orders
GROUP BY day_of_week
ORDER BY day_of_week;
```

1. **Selecting Day of Week:** Extracts the day of the week using the DAYOFWEEK function from the order_time column.
2. **Counting Orders:** Calculates the number of orders for each day of the week using the COUNT function.
3. **Calculating Average Delivery Time:** Computes the average delivery time in minutes using the TIMESTAMPDIFF function.
4. **Grouping and Ordering:** Groups results by the day of the week to identify trends. Orders results for better analysis.

This query helps determine if certain days of the week exhibit longer delivery times or lower order counts, potentially contributing to decreased revenue. Adjust the time units or conditions based on your dataset's specifics.

### Hypothesis 2: Revenue-related Factors
1. **Analyzing the Effect of Discounts**
To investigate the impact of discounts on the final revenue, we'll use the following SQL query:

```sql
-- SQL Query for Discount Analysis
SELECT
  MONTH(order_date) AS month,
  SUM(final_price) AS TotalRevenue,
  SUM(discount) / SUM(final_price) AS discount_sales_ratio,
  SUM(discount) AS TotalDiscount,
  COUNT(order_id) AS OrderCount
FROM orders
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

#### Query Explanation:

1. **Selecting Month:** Extracts the month from the order_date column.
2. **Calculating Total Revenue:** Sums up the final_price to calculate the total revenue for each month.
3. **Calculating Discount Sales Ratio:** Computes the ratio of the total discount to the total revenue, providing insight into the impact of discounts on sales.
4. **Calculating Total Discount:** Determines the overall discount for each month.
5. **Counting Orders:** Counts the number of orders for each month.

This analysis helps us understand whether the application of discounts has resulted in a noticeable change in total revenue, and it provides a ratio indicating the proportion of sales influenced by discounts.

###2. Analyzing Price Levels
To assess whether prices are too high, we'll use the following SQL query:

```sql
-- SQL Query for Price Analysis
SELECT
  AVG(final_price) AS AveragePrice,
  MAX(final_price) AS MaxPrice,
  MIN(final_price) AS MinPrice
FROM orders;
```

#### Query Explanation:

1. **Calculating Average Price:** Computes the average final price across all orders.
2. **Finding Maximum Price:** Identifies the highest final price in the dataset.
3. **Finding Minimum Price:** Identifies the lowest final price in the dataset.

This analysis provides a snapshot of the overall pricing structure, helping us determine whether the prices are within a reasonable range or if there are outliers that might contribute to a negative impact on revenue.
