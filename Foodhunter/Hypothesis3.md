### Hypothesis 3
1. **Delivery Partner Problems**

To investigate the performance of delivery partners and identify any issues affecting delivery times or customer satisfaction, we'll use the following SQL query:

```sql
-- SQL Query for Delivery Partner Performance Analysis
SELECT * FROM
  (
    SELECT
      month,
      driver_id,
      avg_time,
      RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY month ORDER BY avg_time DESC) AS driver_rank
    FROM
      (
        SELECT
          MONTH(order_date) AS month,
          driver_id,
          AVG(MINUTE(TIMEDIFF(order_time, delivered_time))) AS avg_time
        FROM
          orders
        GROUP BY
          month, driver_id
      ) query1
  ) query2
WHERE
  driver_rank BETWEEN 1 AND 5;
```

Query Explanation:

1. **Calculating Average Delivery Time:** The innermost query (query1) calculates the average delivery time for each driver within each month.
2. **Ranking Drivers:** Utilizes the RANK() window function to rank drivers based on their average delivery times within each month.
3. **Filtering Top Drivers:** The outer query (query2) selects the top-performing drivers by filtering those with ranks between 1 and 5.

This analysis aims to identify potential issues in delivery partner performance by focusing on the top-performing drivers based on average delivery times.

The results for the query are as follow:

| Month | Driver ID | Average Delivery Time (minutes) | Driver Rank |
|-------|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------|

Displaying the worst-performing drivers based on average delivery times for each month. Higher average delivery times correspond to poorer performance, and the driver rank indicates their standing within each month. It's evident that certain drivers consistently have longer average delivery times across multiple months, indicating potential areas for improvement.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of delivery partner performance, focusing on the worst-performing drivers in terms of average delivery times, we **accept Hypothesis 3**. The data highlights consistent patterns of certain drivers having longer average delivery times across multiple months, which could impact customer satisfaction.
