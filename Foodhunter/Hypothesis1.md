### Hypothesis 1: Time-based Problems
1. **Weekend vs. Weekday Analysis**
To investigate whether specific times of the day or days of the week correlate with decreased revenue, we'll start by comparing revenue between weekends and weekdays. The following SQL query is designed for this purpose:

```sql
-- SQL Query for Weekend vs. Weekday Analysis
SELECT
  ROUND(SUM(final_price), 2) AS Total_Revenue,
  COUNT(order_id) AS Order_Count,
  CASE
    WHEN DAYOFWEEK(order_date) = 1 THEN 'Weekend'
    WHEN DAYOFWEEK(order_date) = 7 THEN 'Weekend'
    ELSE 'Weekday'
  END AS WDay
FROM orders
GROUP BY WDay;
```

Query Explanation:
1. **Calculating Total Revenue:** Sums up the final_price to calculate the total revenue for weekends and weekdays.
2. **Counting Orders:** Counts the number of orders for each category (Weekend or Weekday).
3. **Categorizing Days:** Utilizes the CASE statement to categorize days into 'Weekend' or 'Weekday' based on the day of the week.

The analysis reveals insights into revenue variations between weekends and weekdays, laying the groundwork for understanding the impact of time on overall revenue.

The results are:

| Total Revenue | Order Count | Day Type |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| 870,423.1     | 31,412      | Weekday  |
| 327,282.9     | 11,706      | Weekend  |

Suggesting a potential correlation between the day of the week and revenue, emphasizing the importance of considering weekdays as the primary contributors to overall revenue. Further analysis will delve into the specific hours of the day to gain a more granular understanding of temporal revenue trends.
