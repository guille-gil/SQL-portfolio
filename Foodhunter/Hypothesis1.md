### Hypothesis 1: Time-based Problems
1. **Weekend vs. Weekday Analysis**

To investigate whether specific times of the day or days of the week correlate with decreased revenue, we'll start by comparing revenue between weekends and weekdays. The following SQL query is designed for this purpose:

```sql
-- SQL Query for Weekend vs. Weekday Analysis
SELECT
  ROUND(SUM(final_price), 2) AS Total_Revenue,
  COUNT(order_id) AS Order_Count,
  CASE
    WHEN DAYOFWEEK(order_date) = 1 THEN 'Weekend'
    WHEN DAYOFWEEK(order_date) = 7 THEN 'Weekend'
    ELSE 'Weekday'
  END AS WDay
FROM orders
GROUP BY WDay;
```

Query Explanation:
1. **Calculating Total Revenue:** Sums up the final_price to calculate the total revenue for weekends and weekdays.
2. **Counting Orders:** Counts the number of orders for each category (Weekend or Weekday).
3. **Categorizing Days:** Utilizes the CASE statement to categorize days into 'Weekend' or 'Weekday' based on the day of the week.

The analysis reveals insights into revenue variations between weekends and weekdays, laying the groundwork for understanding the impact of time on overall revenue.

The results are:

| Total Revenue | Order Count | Day Type |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| 870,423.1     | 31,412      | Weekday  |
| 327,282.9     | 11,706      | Weekend  |

Suggesting a potential correlation between the day of the week and revenue, emphasizing the importance of considering weekdays as the primary contributors to overall revenue. Further analysis will delve into the specific hours of the day to gain a more granular understanding of temporal revenue trends.

2. **Time of Day Analysis**

To delve into the impact of specific times of the day on revenue, we'll utilize the following SQL query:

```sql
-- SQL Query for Time of Day Analysis
SELECT
  order_month,
  time_segment,
  ROUND(total_revenue, 2) AS total_revenue,
  ROUND(
    (
      (total_revenue - LAG(total_revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY order_month))
      / LAG(total_revenue) OVER (PARTITION BY order_month)
    ) * 100,
    2
  ) AS percent_change
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      MONTH(order_date) AS order_month,
      CASE
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 6 AND 11 THEN '6AM-12PM'
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN '12PM-6PM'
        WHEN HOUR(order_time) BETWEEN 18 AND 23 THEN '6PM-12AM'
        ELSE '12AM-6AM'
      END AS time_segment,
      SUM(final_price) AS total_revenue
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY order_month, time_segment
    ORDER BY order_month, total_revenue DESC
  ) t1;
```

Query Explanation:

1. **Categorizing Time Segments:** The innermost query (t1) categorizes orders into time segments based on the time of day ('6AM-12PM,' '12PM-6PM,' '6PM-12AM,' '12AM-6AM').
2. **Calculating Total Revenue:** Sums up the final_price to calculate the total revenue for each order month and time segment.
3. **Calculating Percentage Change:** Utilizes the LAG() window function to calculate the percentage change in total revenue compared to the previous time segment. The percentage change reflects the month-over-month variation in revenue.
5. **Round and Display:** Rounds the total revenue and percentage change values for clearer presentation.

This analysis provides valuable insights into revenue patterns during specific time segments, offering a more nuanced analysis of customer preferences and potential trends over time.

The results reveal variations in total revenue across different times of the day and months:

| Order Month | Time Segment | Total Revenue | Percentage Change |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------------|
| 6           | 12AM-6AM     | 95,218.7      | NULL               |
| 6           | 6AM-12PM     | 94,213.0      | -1.06%             |

| 8           | 6AM-12PM     | 76,159.1      | -1.04%             |
| 8           | 6PM-12AM     | 51,499.9      | -32.38%            |
| 9           | 12AM-6AM     | 71,443.0      | NULL               |
| 9           | 6AM-12PM     | 71,432.1      | -0.02%             |
| 9           | 12PM-6PM     | 68,351.1      | -4.31%             |
| 9           | 6PM-12AM     | 46,934.9      | -31.33%            |

The data reveals fluctuations in total revenue across various time segments ('6AM-12PM,' '12PM-6PM,' '6PM-12AM,) for each order month, with an specifically high decline in revenue in the last segment ('6PM-12AM').

### Conclusion
In conclusion, based on the observed patterns, we **tentatively accept Hypothesis 1** as the data suggests a correlation between specific times and days with fluctuations in revenue. However, continuous monitoring and deeper exploration are recommended for a comprehensive understanding and effective strategic planning.
